# FrontEnd Challenge for BSALE

## Introduction
The challenge requires the implementation of a server and a client side app for an ecommerce drinks store.
The frontend and the backend apps communicate through a REST API(https://bsale-api-aldo-canales.herokuapp.com/api).

##Client Side Application
This demo was built with Vanilla Js and Bootsrap components.
rails-challenge-frontend

├─ README.md
├─ app.js
├─ index.html
├─ styles.css

The index.html file has main static html elements and also templates which will be use to render the products.
The app.js file contains the logic for fetching the products of the store and with using fragments it's loading the products. Also you will see in the last part a shopping cart.

##Development
To run locally clone this repo and open index.html in the browser or with live server. There's no need to install anything since there are no dependencies.

##Production
The project was deployed using Netlify. You can check it in the next url.
